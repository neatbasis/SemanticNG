## Summary

- Describe what changed and why.

## Validation

- [ ] I ran the required tests for this change.
- [ ] If this PR touches `src/state_renormalization/`, I ran all mandatory in-progress milestone commands from `docs/dod_manifest.json`.
- [ ] For every capability status transition in `docs/dod_manifest.json`, this PR description includes the exact milestone `pytest` command(s) from the manifest and linked passing evidence for each command (CI run URL, job URL, or command output snippet).
- [ ] If this PR includes `planned -> in_progress`, `in_progress -> done`, `prototype -> operational`, or `operational -> proven`, I followed `docs/release_checklist.md` → **Capability and Contract Promotion Rubric** and documented any exception rollback/follow-up notes.
