# Python Version Analysis

## Current target

The project minimum supported Python version is **3.11**.

## Baseline contract alignment

The minimum-version contract is defined by `pyproject.toml` `[project].requires-python` and must stay aligned with contributor-facing docs and CI default `setup-python` versions.

## Notes

This document treats Python 3.11 as the active baseline and does not use Python 3.10 as the baseline target.
