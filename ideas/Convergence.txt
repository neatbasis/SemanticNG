Convergence:

presenting multiple instances the same invariant test to make it easy to constrain probable next thing

As in this prompt example to collect projections after a session which has dealt with identities related to the ask:


```
Add `MISSION.md` (or expand `README.md` with a first section) containing:

* One-sentence mission
* 3–5 north-star principles (invariants, evidence, contracts, behavior tests)
* Clear non-goals for current phase

Use wording that references current modules (`contracts.py`, `invariants.py`, `engine.py`) so readers can jump from concept to code quickly.

```
