# CANONICALIZATION

Let `κ` canonicalize semantic boundary state.

- **Idempotency:** `κ(κ(x)) = κ(x)`.
- **Unique representative:** every observable-equivalence class has one canonical boundary form (canonical version export + stable bridge behavior).
- **Commutation requirement:** for admissible `τ`, `κ(τ(x)) = τ(κ(x))`.

Failure implies non-canonical boundary semantics.
