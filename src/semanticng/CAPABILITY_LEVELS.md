# CAPABILITY_LEVELS

Staged maturity guarantees for `src/semanticng`:

- **L0 (Declared):** local semantic constraints are explicitly documented.
- **L1 (Stable boundary):** version export and bridge role are consistently enforced.
- **L2 (Controlled evolution):** boundary edits validated for invariant preservation and canonical commutation.
- **L3 (Auditable semantics):** failures are classifiable and block incompatible releases.
